      <h1>Early Life</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Tacoma, Washington, graduating from <a href="http://www.bellarmineprep.org/">Bellarmine Prep</a> in 1980.  Tacoma in the 1960s and 1970s was known for smelters and pulp mills and a decaying downtown core.  However, my world in Tacoma's North End was good.</p>

      <h1>In my Twenties</h1>
      <p>Upon graduating highschool, I had three primary goals in life:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Party</li>
        <li>Party</li>
        <li>Party</li>
      </ol>

      <p>While these goals were rather easily achieved, they were not particularly conducive to career advancement.  I eventually enrolled at now-defunct Knapp Business College, earned a certificate in computer programming, and in March of 1986, started work at Safeco Insurance as a DP Courier.</p>
